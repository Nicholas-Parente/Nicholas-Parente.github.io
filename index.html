									<h3>Narrative for the Software Design and Engineering Artifact Enhancement:</h3>
									<p></p>
									<div class="container">
										<p>	The artifact selected for this enhancement is a mock medical application from CS-320: 
											Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. This application was created prior 
											to my enrollment in the course but was reviewed during the Fall 2020 semester as a part of 
											the course. The medical application is programmed in Java, and was designed to be flawed, and the 
											student was responsible for the quality assurance of the application, creating unit tests, and 
											following customer criteria to find bugs. </p>
										<p> This item was selected for the my ePortfolio because of the difficulty I faced during the class 
											this application came from. I was able to overcome the challenge of not only understanding/navigating
											the application, but developing the tests needed to prove the presence of the bugs within the application. 
											Also, this artifact can help to showcase my development skills, since the original artifact utilized a 
											series of ArrayLists for data input, multiple classes interacting with one another, and it has a variety 
											of flaws to improve upon, such as error and exception handling. This artifact was improved by fixing the 
											known flaws in the application from CS-320, which included being able to add multiple doctors with the same 
											I.D., adding medications before adding a treatment, not printing all of the patients with a certain allergy, 
											as well as the multiple exceptions thrown due to incorrect user input. Other improvements made include the 
											addition of simple encryption for the password, using a nested dictionary instead of a series of lists, as well
											as storing and loading data for the patients and doctors using .txt files. </p>

										<p>	I believe that, through this artifact, I have met or exceeded the course outcomes/course objectives for this enhancement, 
											because this artifact shows the ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing and accomplishing goals, 
											the ability to solve logic programs and program solutions, the ability to address potential design flaws pertaining to 
											security, and the ability to articulate my ideas through the working product, which align with the possible indicators 
											of success for the enhancement. </p>
										
										<p>	The enhancing/modifying process for this artifact started with mapping out the consistencies/inconsistencies between the 
											language the application was originally programmed in (Java) and the language the application was going to be transferred 
											to (Python). Once this understanding was developed, the next phase was developing the data structure for the patients and 
											doctors, as using a complex series of lists did not seem like the best option. I ended up going with a nested dictionary, 
											which was able to contain lists and mapped pairs for all of the data related to the patients and doctors. After the data structure
											was refined, the functionality for the simple encryption, as well as the data storing was developed, and with all of these 
											components in place, the last phase was developing the menu options, as well as the error handling for the user input. I chose 
											Python to transfer to because I wanted to test my skills with this language, as I had less experience with this language 
											compared to the other languages I have used (Java and C/C++). This resulted in me learning a lot about developing in the language, 
											the pitfalls with the chosen IDE, and the benefits to using the language over the other two I knew. Developing in Python 
											made error handling for user input far easier than it would be with Java, since you do not have to declare a variable type in Python. 
											As for the IDE, I chose Jupyter Notebook as it was the only IDE for Python I had direct experience with, but as far as I can tell, 
											Jupyter Notebook does not have breakpoints and debugging capabilities that other IDE’s, such as Netbeans for Java and Visual Studio 
											for C++ have, that I have become accustomed to, which made debugging more complicated. The primary challenges that I faced came from 
											designing the nested dictionaries and from storing/loading the data from the nested dictionaries to text files. Because the user can 
											enter multiple values for certain characteristics (treatments, medications, and allergies), trying to figure out a way to store all 
											of this data, then trying to save it/load it in the same configuration took the most time.</p>

									<h3>Narrative for the Algorithms and Data Structure Artifact Enhancement:</h3>
									<p></p>
									<div class="container">
										<p>The artifact selected for this enhancement is an application designed for CS-260: Data Structures and Algorithms, which 
											allows a user to view bidding data from a .csv file imported into a binary search tree, and see the speed of completing 
											tasks in the application. The application was created prior to my enrollment in the course but was reviewed during the Spring 
											2020 semester as part of the course requirements. The bidding application is programmed in C++, and was designed to only provide 
											the basic framework, with the student creating the applications data structures and algorithms to complete the menu item tasks.</p>
										<p>This item was selected for my ePortfolio because of not only the complexity of the data structures and algorithms developed for the 
											course, but the lack of error and exception handling the application had when completed, as this was not a major requirement for the 
											application. I wanted to go back and “clean-up” this application, as well as test my skills working with binary search trees and 
											recursive methods.Also, this artifact can help to show my capabilities with not only understanding how to interpret data structures 
											and recursion, but my capabilities programming and problem solving with those structures and recursive functions, as well as my 
											error handling and exception handling capabilities.This artifact was first improved by adding error handling and exception handling, 
											as well as removing the user’s capability to pass variables to the application from the command line, as this can pose a security 
											risk to the application. Next, it was improved by removing the hard coded variables for what to search for and what to remove, 
											giving the user the capability to search for specific bid I.D.’s to find and remove (extra error and exception handling had to 
											be implemented for this too). Lastly, extra functionality was included into the application, with the user being able to print 
											bids up to a certain I.D., instead of having to print either all of the bids or just a single bid.</p>
										<p>I believe that, through this artifact, I have met or exceeded the course outcomes/course objectives for this enhancement, because 
											this artifact shows my ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing and accomplishing goals, my ability 
											to solve logic problems and program solutions using data structures and algorithms, my ability to address design flaws, including 
											those flaws pertaining to security, and my ability to articulate ideas and accomplishments through my working product, 
											which aligns with the possible indicators of success for this enhancement. </p>
										<p>The enhancing/modifying process for this artifact started with including error and exception handling for the main menu of the application, 
											as this was not originally done, and an incorrect input would cause a crash. The next phase was to remove the hard-coded variables for the 
											bid I.D. that was used to implement the search and remove features of the application. This was done by adding user input to the search 
											and remove function, as well as providing the same error and exception handling that was previously implemented. After this, the next 
											phase was to include the functionality enhancement to the application, which was the allow the user to print up to a certain bid I.D. 
											from the whole list. This was accomplished using the binary search tree of bids being used by the other functions in the application, 
											but with the inclusion of recursion to navigate to the far left of the tree, then validating if the node’s bid I.D. was less than the 
											bid I.D. being requested by the user. If it was smaller, it would print and shift to the next node, if it was larger it would return. 
											Lastly, the application was re-commented, as there were many “fix it” comments within the application that needed to be removed, 
											as well as incorrect comments throughout. The primary challenge I faced while developing this enhancement was navigating and understanding
											the binary search tree, as well as how the recursion would function with my added functionality. This gave me a platform to learn off of,
											and through debugging the application, I was able to learn how the tree was structured, as well as how the recursive functions worked within the application.</p>
